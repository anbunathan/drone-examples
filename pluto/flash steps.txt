After connecting Pluto Xâ€™s WiFi to the computer, select the Flash command from the
toolbar

Full Flash: Burn the code onto Pluto X by erasing ROM data like sensor
calibration.

Normal Flash: Burn the code onto Pluto X without erasing ROM data like sensor
calibration.

It is recommended to use Full Flash when programming for the first time.

Be sure to
calibrate the accelerometer and magnetometer sensors after every Full Flash.
